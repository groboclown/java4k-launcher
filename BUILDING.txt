
=============================================================================
FOR GAME DEVELOPERS:

You will need Ant version 1.8 or higher, and a JDK version 1.6 or higher in
order to compile and run the build yourself.


Some top level commands you may use:

$ ant clean

    Delete all the generated files.


$ ant main

    Compile and bundle the tool.


$ ant load-cache

    Download the files from the java4k.com site into the bundle's cache.  This
    can take a while, and limiters on the java4k.com site may restrict how much
    you can download at once - it may take several attempts.


For the application itself (java4k or java4k.bat), you can pass in the "-d"
option (for "developer") to allow the application to load a local HTML file that
includes an <applet> tag.  This will help you test your game to ensure it works
with the launcher in its security sandbox.


=============================================================================
FOR LAUNCHER DEVELOPERS:


You can pass a "-g" argument to the launcher to turn off the security manager
to allow easier debugging via an IDE.
